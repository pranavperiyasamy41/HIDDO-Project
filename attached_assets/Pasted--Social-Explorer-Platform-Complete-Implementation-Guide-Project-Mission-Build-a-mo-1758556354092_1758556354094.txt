## **Location-Based Features**

### **Interactive Map Integration**
Build a comprehensive map view using Google Maps API where users can see posts as markers. Implement clustering for areas with many posts to prevent visual clutter. Create heat map overlays showing popular exploration areas. Enable users to click on any location marker to view the full post details. Integrate with Google Maps for navigation to specific locations.

### **Location Services**
Implement geofenced notifications that alert users when they're near interesting posts or popular exploration areas. Create location-based suggestions using Google Places API to recommend nearby points of interest. Build a system that tracks and suggests new locations based on user exploration patterns. Enable location-based search and filtering.

### **Geographic Features**
Store all location data using proper geospatial indexing for fast proximity searches. Implement privacy controls for location sharing. Create location history and statistics for users. Enable location verification to ensure posts are genuinely from claimed locations.
